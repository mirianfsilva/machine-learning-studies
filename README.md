## Machine Learning Scientist - Studies

This repository contains some of my currently Machine Learning studies.

To increase my essential skills in that topic. All items developed are in the Python language and I will use tools to perform supervised, unsupervised and deep learning (to be used as tutorials in the future).

__Current approaches__: Data processing, model training, evaluation performance and parameter adjustment for better performance.

__Future approaches__: Natural language processing, image processing and popular libraries, such as Spark and Keras.
