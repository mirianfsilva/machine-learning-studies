## Machine Learning Scientist - Studies

This repository contains some of my Machine Learning studies.

To increase my essential skills in that topic. All items developed, in order to be used as tutorials in the future, are in Python and will have tools to perform supervised, unsupervised and deep learning.

Current approaches: Data processing, model training, evaluation performance and parameter adjustment for better performance.

Future approaches: Natural language processing, image processing and popular libraries, such as Spark and Keras.
