### Supervised Machine Learning

- Predict Variables/features and a target variable.
- Aim: Predict the target variable, given the predictor variables.

The goal of supervised learning is frequently to either automate a time-consuming or expensive manual task. 
Need labeled data: historical data with labels, experiments to get labeled data, crowd-sourcing labeled data. 

Some exploratory data analysis using samples from scikit-learn:

**Classification**: Target variable consists of categories. 
    - Iris sample data exploratory; 
    - Digits sample data exploratory;

**Regression**: Target variable is continuous.
